# Pomodoro-AF

This is a hobby project to create a simple Pomodoro device that can sit on a
desk and be quickly and trivially activated to start a focus session. Yes,
these exist and can be purchased from Amazon, but it doesn't mean they
**should** be purchased.

## Goals
The current stated goals for the project are

- Make a physical device I personally **love** to use every day
- Learn Embassy-rs and apply it to a useful project
- Design a Pomodoro that is
    - Simple and obvious to use
    - Open Source, both software and hardware designs
    - Hackable & extendable

## Principles of Pomodoro Method
Taken from the [Todist](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) website the method consists of the following

1. Pick a task
2. Set a 25-minute timer
3. Work on your task until the time is up
4. Take a 5-minute break
5. Every 4 pomodoros, take a longer 15-30 minute break
